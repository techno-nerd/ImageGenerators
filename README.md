# Image Generators

Recently, models like Dall-e 3 and Stable Diffusion have gained a lot of attention because of the stunning images they generate.

In this project, we will look at two image generation architectures: Generative Adverserial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion models.

The `mnist_gan.ipynb` shows how a Generative Adverserial Network (GAN) can be trained to generate digits from 0-9. The `pokemon` folder has data and a baseline for training a pokemon generation GAN. However, it's performance is not very good because GANs as a whole are not the best at image generation. 

`app.py` is a website where you can experiment with diffusion and a pre-trained MNIST GAN. You can access it [here]()
